Mercator is a quantitative financial research and signal generation platform that combines artificial intelligence, natural language processing (NLP), statistical models, and reinforcement learning to anticipate trends, volatility, and structural changes in financial markets. Its architecture integrates five main modules: a Transformer-based financial sentiment analyzer, a market regime detector using Hidden Markov Models, a dynamic covariance estimator using LSTM networks, a portfolio optimizer under real constraints with cvxpy, and a Reinforcement Learning agent that adjusts portfolio exposure according to changing market conditions.

The project will succeed because it combines complementary models: NLP provides early signals derived from unstructured information (news and reports), the HMM identifies the current market phase, the LSTM captures complex time dependencies, and the RL learns adaptive policies that maximize risk-adjusted returns. This integration creates a robust, interpretable, and adaptable system that serves not only as a technical demonstrator but also as a real engine for generating quantitative signals, useful for both personal portfolio management and future institutional applications.
